# Framework
RethinkDB ORM.

To run a test, make sure to create a 'user' and 'country' table in either your own rethink db, or in the 'test' DB. If not using the test DB, specify 'db' in the DB options that are passed in the bootstrap function of the framework. To run test, simply compile and run the index file in dist/test.
